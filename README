I used version 3.6.4
Decompres the files to a folder and follow the instructions to update the .lnk for launching octave (set notepad++ to work as the text editor...)
Also, in order to get the octave-forge packages (signal is needed), restart octave and run
pkg rebuild -auto
Remove ad package, which crashes octave in Win7...
pkg rebuild -noauto ad
cd to the analysis folder and use as you'd use Matlab, i.e.
>reflex2013Analysis

readSMR.m contains an  example (you'll have to provide your own .smr -file...

TODO
Combine analysing several recordings from a single file and analyse subsequently. Just concat the data...
